Ah, that Steven Pinker. Wonderful. I just finished &#8216;How the mind works&#8217; and have to say the man combines scientific brilliance with imagination like few others out there. The book is far too dense to regurgitate here. I had put the book down for months at a time, to pick up (mostly when I had nothing better to do) and push along for a few pages. My reading of the book progressed in this fashion not because it wasn&#8217;t engaging, good, thought provoking, but rather that, well, I just don&#8217;t read that way anymore. I scan these days unless something is really compelling. Anyhow, best part of my latest reading session:

The Yiddish have a saying:

> _If god lived on earth people would throw stones at his windows_.

Enough said. Check it out &#8211; worth reading.
