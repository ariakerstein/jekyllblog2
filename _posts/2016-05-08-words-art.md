Art consists of 2 parts:

  * Hypnosis of the consumer
  * Altered perception of some aspect of realityÂ once the art is over (it lives like a config file in the mind).

I used to think of great art as my willingness to submit as a viewer to the artist&#8217;s vision. That&#8217;s basically hypnosis. But hypnosis alone is entertainment. Great art leaves a lasting alteration of perception.
