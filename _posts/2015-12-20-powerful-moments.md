I did a powerlifting class yesterday. I&#8217;m built like a runner &#8211; definitely not going to win any competitions snatching weights overhead. But the more powerful part of the sport for me is actually the moment \*before\* the lift. For me at least there is a tremendous focus of energy (visual, neuro-muscular, processing doubt and overcoming it) into visualizing the lift I&#8217;m about to complete; improper execution would hurt! I used to do this visualization before competitions but it&#8217;s been a while. I&#8217;ll continue if only for that moment of sublime focus in hopes of re-patterning this circuit for other aspects of my lift. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2305" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.samuelakerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/snatch.jpg?fit=650%2C325" alt="snatch" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.samuelakerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/snatch.jpg?w=650 650w, https://i1.wp.com/www.samuelakerstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/snatch.jpg?resize=300%2C150 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />
