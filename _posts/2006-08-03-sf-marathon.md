3:20 was my time.

I felt strong for the first half. I think the avg. time was 7:16 / mile. Unfortunately I stepped wrong in a pot hole in gg park about mile 15. It didn&#8217;t feel like anything, but a mile or so later my hamstring seized up on me. I shrugged it off after a wave of crippling fear overcame me that I wouldn&#8217;t finish. So I slowed to a trot for a few miles and was feeling almost back to normal when it happened again. This had actually never happened on any previous runs, so I decided to abandon any hopes of (completely delusional) grandeur and resigned myself to enjoy the experience as best I could.<!--more-->

But as I slowed down the pain really started, my feet and ankles felt as though they were not meant for one another. with each step the pounding magnified until a dull numbness took over, providing a welcome band-aid solution. It was like a negative feedback loop; once I started to slow down, admitting a loss of integrity in my right hamstring, my strength just grinded to a seeming halt.

Anyway, an experience I&#8217;m glad to have had. Surely it will not be the last.
  
my condolences to the wife and family of the gentleman that passed on the course.
