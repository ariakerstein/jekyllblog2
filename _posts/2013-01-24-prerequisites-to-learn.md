Learning is a function of confidence. Â Learning occurs in large measure through exposure to new situations and by asking questions of peers. Both require a measure of fearlessness to venture into the unknown, to escape our comfort zones, to run experiments. Without confidence learning is still possible &#8211; just exponentially harder. Putting onesself into new situations &#8211; socially, professionally, geographically &#8211; accelerates learning.
