Tonight I had a realization. Saul was on the change table, I was cupping his tiny head in my hand. He started to coo. He was speaking baby. No meaning to the words, but importance &#8211; to him. The imperative of life is to express it&#8217;s will. That will could be free or genetically determined. Either way, that&#8217;s the point. Not the content of the expression, but rather it&#8217;s existence.

Saul teaches me things already.
