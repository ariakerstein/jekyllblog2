The essence of excellence, and of love, is to spend the time with the activity.  This applies to fathering, to coding, and any other pursuit. And this is a beautiful thing.  In a world that feels ever increasingly comprised of quick fixes, caffeine and sugar, this reinforces the  plain fact that the atoms of excellence are minutes of love (ok, at least directionally: cursing, spitting, shouting, throwing,  hair pulling and existential anguish are also integral parts of the process!).

To learn a thing, to love a thing and to excel at a thing, one must above all spend (deliberate) time with the thing.
