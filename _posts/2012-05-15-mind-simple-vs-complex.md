Minds can be simple and/or they can be complex: appreciating a flower, conceiving the theory of relativity. That simple and complex both exist as available possibilities to our minds is perplexing.Â  Which is the more desirable state? Should we dedicate our efforts in pursuit of one or the other? Or should we strive for balance, existing somewhere in the middle?

My take is that the beauty of existence lies in the flow state as has been [described elsewhere](http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html). It is irrelevant if one ponders in a simple or a complex way. Whether the activity is pondering the workings of the cosmos, simple appreciation of the outputs of the cosmos (a flower), the key to satisfaction and production of \*value\* is to enter the flow state. I would argue that the contributions of the Buddha and Einstein are of equal worth (at least both are immensely worthy, nevermind the comparison!). Doing good work is dependent on flow. To own a thing, one must flow with a thing. That&#8217;s my opinion.
