What will I teach my baby? If something like [60-70% of communication is non-verbal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language).Â It seems to me that the bulk of the fatherly lessons I&#8217;ll give will occur implicitly &#8211; via my ways of being &#8211; rather than by the explicit communication of values and knowledge. The amount of knowledge I could convey &#8211; even if I downloaded my brain to him &#8211; is limited. But I am hopeful. If I can live in a manner that is authentic to myself and my own values that this will resonate with the power of truth &#8211; it&#8217;ll rub off on him. Giving knowledge is important. But more important is to impart the desire for it. I snapped the photo below one morning and it reminded me about this kernel of insight.

Finally, consider the most important moments in your life. If it&#8217;s anything like mine, it&#8217;s likely composed of a disproportionately large portion of non-verbal moments shared with others; playing catch with your dad; waving goodbye to your lover at the airport; etc. The power of non-verbals is not to be discounted in favor of elaborate higher cortical plans. It&#8217;s cheaper to implement and will probably leave a more lasting impression.
