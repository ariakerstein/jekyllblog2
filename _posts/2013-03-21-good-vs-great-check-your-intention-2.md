I watched a street performer &#8211; musician &#8211; in the Bart station. He was pretty good, on key, twangy voice reminiscent of a young bob Dylan. He was also louder than the typical Bart performer. His intention was to express himself, his music. But The better musicians start with the opposite intention; they start with a desire to delight the listener. This is also true of teachers. Some lecturers with the intention of proving their smarts: they talk too fast. Better, more loved lecturers want the listener to understand the message. As a listener I am keenly aware of the difference and am all the more appreciative when ego is placed aside in favor of genuinely communicating a message.
