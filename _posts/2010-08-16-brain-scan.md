Our thoughts must be encoded somewhere in our neurons &#8211; not IN neurons but in the way they wire up and fire up. Would it be possible to scan those connections &#8211; in essence probing the circuits to reveal their structure? We do this crudely (with varying degrees of efficacy) with questions, but could we diagnose a person (e.g., as holding certain ideas, or thought patterns) by running some type of as yet unknown script? Thoughts are, of course, not static things contained in a brain but rather are persistently self-pruning within the neural landscape.

I wonder how much of our thinking is deterministic. Could we ask a person the same question, something totally mundane like: &#8216;do you like blue?&#8217; and get a consistent answer on different days (assuming they haven&#8217;t explicitly changed their &#8216;mind&#8217;). More to the point, linguists have shown that by activating certain &#8216;frames&#8217; respondents will answer questions differently. This is quite interesting and alludes to the idea of &#8216;priming&#8217; when it comes to manipulation. But my interest here is not explicit manipulation but rather in two items: the self-delusion of, let&#8217;s call it self-reporting; and in the underlying intent of a word, phrase, or idea.

We tell ourselves narratives, about the world, about ourselves, and surely believe them to an extent.Â  Perhaps the most empirical of people, then, are those that recognize and can&#8217;t believe their own stories. Deep Skeptics.
