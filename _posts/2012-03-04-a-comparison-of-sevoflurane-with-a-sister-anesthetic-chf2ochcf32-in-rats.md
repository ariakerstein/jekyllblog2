Here's a paper I wrote while working as a molecular biologist researcher at UCSF exploring the possibility of brain metabolite formation in response to inhaled anesthetics. This is important, in part, since there is a link between exposure to these agents and cognitive impairment in children. 
  
This study also compares performance of sevoflurane, one of the most popular inhaled anesthetics on earth, to a structurally similar (one atom difference!) variant that offers some promising anesthetic benefits.
