Let me start by saying that originally I was tempted to write off this marathon as an outlier. With race times illustrating a predictable trend in the good direction, this was a real surprise. Chronologically: 3:17, 3:09, 3:03, 2:58, 3:01&#8230;3:22(ouch!). This was my slowest marathon time since starting distance running: 21 minutes slower than last year on the same course; 4 minutes slower than my first marathon at SF (with a sprained knee).

But failure is a major mechanism of learning. To dismiss this race would be to miss an important opportunity to reflect on the cause of the failure (interesting to ASA).

The details.

I start pretty fast (~6:40-6:50/mi), keeping pace with Abe (who ran a stellar 2:59!). But it was smooth and easy. Before half way I knew I was weak. Abe surged ahead. I assessed my condition. I was on pace by the half to break 3:00. But my hamstrings were starting to cramp. No strength to push for a negative split (a temptation). Right patella felt strained. Real trouble by mile 15. Pace slips from 6:52 to 7:30 and slower. I abandoned my ambitions. Lowered the bar. I resolved to enjoy the race. Unrealistic goal by then; incredible pain.
  
Memory of being still qualified for next year&#8217;s race (from last year) temporarily soothed the ego.

Feelings of dissociation from my body with 10+ miles remaining was troubling.
  
Goal: re-associate with body.
  
Method: Focus on a cloud and count breaths. To each breath 3 steps.
  
Experiment: count to 100 and reassess condition. Result: pace drops to 6:52 from 8:15. Good. Repeat.
  
Goal: attempt to double previous count. Fail at 170; mind unable to focus, eyes saccade erratically. Form akin to running with heavy ankle weights.

Mile 21: pain unbearable. No meaning to suffering. _Continue. More. Go._
  
_Why_?
  
**WHY!**
  
. . .
  
No more! Cannot.

I had to walk. I Resigned to walk to the end. An agonizing grimace scares onlooking children. Fear noted, grimace removed. Predicted finish time > 4:00 if lucky. A racing mind (a decidedly un-racing body). Self reconciles the abstract notion and implications of walking a race while&#8230; walking a race. High bib numbers pass like rushing water. Defeat. Yet kind of soothing. Nothing but a desire to stop. To be done.
  
A compromise: stretch and see. Walk to sidewalk. Lift one leg onto guard rail. Stretch and self massage. Like tetanus. Repeat.
  
Goal: jog and remain upright. Success.
  
-And Pain.
  
Goal: finish with dignity.
  
Method: combine jog with breath counting. The approach works. Breath counts now significantly lower than 170 (30-50 range before having to start over).

Closing remarks.
  
Define and execute only goals with purpose that motivate. Saying NO to say yes is virtuous. Else ad-hoc strings of goals build up aimed at mere damage control &#8211; called putting out the fires. This was the overwhelming feeling I had during the race. Oh and the legs.
  
The inherently quantitative nature of distance running makes it an ideal goal-setting activity. But it also can act as an indicator of other things in a person&#8217;s life. In this case, over committing (6 major undertakings). Do less well. Relax. Abandon previously defined goals when they no longer fit one&#8217;s priority framework.
  
Don&#8217;t change the priority framework often.

In retrospect I would still probably have run the race (after all the Boston marathon is a great excuse to see my family). But I would have planned for a VERY slow time, properly aligned with my training load (i.e. low&#8230; even for me). And I would have enjoyed the run. After all, running should be enjoyable.

Right?
