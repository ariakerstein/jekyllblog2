Ah, the trials and tribulations of being an entrepreneur!

Today  we address receiving large shipments from overseas. Refer back to this experience in the future; remember there once was a day when you had to earn your food by the sweat of your brow and brawn.

So, earlier today thousands of units finally arrived from China &#8211; hundreds of master-packed boxes of product. Mistake: I assumed I would have unlimited time to unload the truck.

Nope!

The driver told me I have 15 minutes to off-load the truck before he is going to leave &#8211; with my stuff if needed! So I did what any sensible entrepreneur would do in the situation; I hired dudes off the street to help move them into storage! Talk about hustle. These guys impressed me! They were working to feed their kids. And I realized \*TRULY\* how good a thing it is to have the means to pay another man for his labor. I realized that I was satisfied for having completed the task at hand. But I was more satisfied that I was able to pay these guys for honest work. And I paid them well.

That said, I hope NEVER to have to repeat this experience. Totally stressful!
