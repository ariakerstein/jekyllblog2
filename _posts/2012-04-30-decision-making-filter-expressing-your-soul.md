I considered a run. In fact I kind of agonized over it for 5 minutes. Why?

The dusk was perfect. I had all my clothes. The baby was quiet and Michelle, my angel, said she would do anything I wanted (read, take baby to a cafe while I run). I passed on the run, opting to grab dinner at our favoriteÂ  dumpling house instead. It felt more right in the moment.
  
Challenge: balance rational and planned goals with spontaneity and joy. Ask: how do I express my soul, given the decisions in front of me. And when you make the decision, don&#8217;t look back. Rather, enjoy the details of your decision. Why is this so difficult sometimes?
