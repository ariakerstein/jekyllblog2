I listened to cartalk the other day while driving to golden gate park for a run. I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about the &#8216;puzzlah&#8217; so had to give the solution a shot.

> You have 1000 $1 bills. You are given 10 envelopes into which you must place configurations of dollars so that you could hand a stranger the exact number asked for, up to $1000.

Here&#8217;s my solution.
