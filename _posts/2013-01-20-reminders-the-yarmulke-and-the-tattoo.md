Tattoos, in addition to decoration and social signaling, can also serve as reminders: something you stand for, a phrase that inspires you, your girlfriends name. Yarmulkes also remind &#8211; that G-d is above the wearer. Â The big difference &#8211; apart from the content &#8211; is that yarmulkes fall off while tattoos don&#8217;t. +1 for Tattoos! This seems like it would make the yarmulke the inferior of the two reminder tools. But turns out that habit is the ultimate reminder &#8211; not the content alone. Keeping a yarmulke on your head is a habit &#8211; it requires active engagement to keep it on.
